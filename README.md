This app makes use of several javascript methods. The user's string input is converted into an array of single-letter string elements via the split method, then reversed via the reverse method and converted back to a string via the join method. The makeLowerCase method is applied to ensure that accurate comparisons can be made for inputs with instances of upper case letters. The input is a palindrome if the original input and its reverse are strictly equal to one another.# palindromeExpress
